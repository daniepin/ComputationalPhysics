In this project we determine numerically the paths of the planetary bodies in the solar system, using the Euler and velocity Verlet methods. The results are interpreted and compared with relativistic and Newtonian perspectives. We simulate and plot the perihelion precession of Mercury with and without relativistic correction, and find a correspondence with the observed values to an error of $\approx 10''$. The code has been created in an object oriented way, to ensure re-usability of functions and to learn better ways to structure code.
